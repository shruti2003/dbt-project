# 🏅 Olympics Data Analysis (CS 378)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing Olympic Games data** using **dbt, Google Cloud, and BigQuery**. The dataset includes records of **athletes, events, and medal winners** spanning multiple Olympic Games. The goal is to **identify patterns, outliers, and trends** in the data, such as:  
- **Athlete performance trends** over time  
- **Country-wise medal distributions**  
- **Event-specific insights**  
- **Outlier detection** (e.g., unexpected performance spikes, anomalies in medal counts)  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **dbt** (Data Build Tool) for **data transformation and modeling**  
- **Google Cloud & BigQuery** for **data storage and querying**  
- **SQL** for **data aggregation and cleaning**  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for **statistical analysis & visualization**  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Medal Trends:** Analysis of how **medal counts** have changed over decades  
- **Country Dominance:** Identification of countries with **consistent high performances**  
- **Outliers:** Detecting **unexpected performances** (e.g., lesser-known athletes winning multiple medals)  
- **Event Popularity:** Evaluating **which sports/events** have gained/lost popularity
